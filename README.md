# 🚀 Keerthi Peddireddy – Interactive Portfolio

This is my personal **interactive portfolio website** built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s designed to showcase my technical skills, projects, and experience in a way that reflects my strengths as a **Software Engineer with a focus on AI/ML**.

🔗 **Live Site:** https://Keerthi11123.github.io/Keerthi_Peddireddy/

## 🎯 Why I Built This
Most resumes and PDFs are static, but I wanted to show:
- That I can design and build **interactive, user-friendly web apps** from scratch.  
- How I combine **engineering and AI/ML expertise** into clean, functional systems.  
- My ability to create **scalable, maintainable, and visually engaging** solutions.  

This portfolio is not just a digital resume—it’s a **demonstration of my technical ability**.
